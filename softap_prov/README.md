For every new IoT products especially for consumer products, it is very important for the consumer to be able to provision the wifi-credentials on the product. 

For provisioning process, devices are configured as a Wi-Fi station with specified credentials. Once configured, the device will retain the Wi-Fi configuration, until a flash erase is performed.

Right after provisioning is complete, Wi-Fi SoftAP and the HTTP server are deactivated. Though, that is specific to this example, and the user can choose to keep SoftAP HTTP server active in their own application.
